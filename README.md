# PyRanoid :lock: ![Tests](https://github.com/omnone/pyRanoid/workflows/Tests/badge.svg) ![CodeQL](https://github.com/omnone/pyRanoid/workflows/CodeQL/badge.svg)
**PyRanoid** allows you to **encrypt your data** , text or even a file, using [AES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard) encryption and then to encode it/hide it to an PNG image using an lsb [steganography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography) algorithm. If you feel extra paranoid you can add some RSA encryption on top. Currently RSA encryption is only supported throught the GUI version. Currently tested only with Python 3.9.
